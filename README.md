# Programming Challenges

This repository contains solutions to various programming problems found on the [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) website, based on problems commonly asked in company interviews. The problems are sourced from this [list of company-wise LeetCode problems](https://github.com/hxu296/leetcode-company-wise-problems-2022), which provides a curated set of questions that have been asked in real-life technical interviews at major tech companies.

The goal is to practice and improve problem-solving skills using different data structures and algorithms, with solutions implemented in **Swift**.

Each solution is contained in a dedicated **Playground file**. Swift Playgrounds provide a great environment for testing and running Swift code interactively, making them an ideal choice for these types of challenges.

## Problems Included

### 1. [Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)

**Description**: Given a string `s` containing only the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', the task is to determine if the input string is valid. The string is considered valid if:

- Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
- Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.

This is the first problem solved in this repository, based on the problems listed in the aforementioned curated repository. The solution can be found in the corresponding Swift Playground file.
